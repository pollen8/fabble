# Fabble son of Fabrik

## Purpose

Create a no/low code environment for users to create SPA.

Users can use API keys to query different APIs (not oAuth for now)

App logic should be modelled via xState - might need an alt visualizer linking states and transitions to web pages.

## Run 

Server
```
cd server 
npm start
```

Client
```
cd client
npm run dev
```
