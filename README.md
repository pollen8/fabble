## Purpose

Create a no/low code environment for users to create SPA.

Users can use API keys to query different APIs (not oAuth for now)

App logic should be modelled via xState - might need an alt visualizer linking states and transitions to web pages.


## Stages

* Produce a single page designed by DnD editor, saved and loaded to file format
* Create wrapper skeleton app to consume and host app.
* Connect a DataList element to a predefined data source
*
